## Fibonacci Problem

My solution for this problem was made in reference to [this article](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/deriving-and-understanding-binets-formula-for-the-fibonacci-sequence-4cc2693838b0).

Note that my solution gives the correct answer only up to the 70th Fibonacci number and the value
passed in must be positive (`n` $\geq$ 0). Values after the 70th number will be only approximate. However, this solution gives the quickest ($O(1)$) result and is simple to both understand and implement, which is why I chose it. Other solutions may also require more space.

## Merge List Problem

My solution works assuming that the arguments passed in are list of strings (of any length).
